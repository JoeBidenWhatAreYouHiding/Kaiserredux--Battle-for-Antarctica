trotskyism_subtype:0 "Trotskyism"
trotskyism_subtype_desc:0 "Trotskyism is a radical and exilic outgrowth of orthodox Internationalist theory, forged in the aftermath of revolutionary defeat and the personal exile of Leon Trotsky to the southernmost reaches of the world. Following the collapse of the revolutionary war effort, Trotsky fled eastward across the Bering Strait and vanished from the centers of politics, being blamed by the defeated Soviet leadership for the loss of the Russian Civil War. From obscurity he eventually reemerged in Antarctica, where isolation, scarcity, and hostility reshaped his doctrine. Cut off from industrial workers and party structures, Trotskyism was reinterpreted as a creed of pure Permanent Revolution, no longer dependent on cities or factories but on discipline, collective endurance, and ideological fanaticism. Penguins came to symbolize the Antarctic proletariat, communal, tireless, egalitarian, and indifferent to borders, serving as both metaphor and mythic vanguard of the coming revolution. Recently, Trotskyism has adopted apocalyptic and messianic tones, portraying Trotsky as a prophetic figure whose exile was preparation rather than failure. As expeditions slowly coalesced into armed communes and icebreakers began to turn northward, the Revolution From The South was proclaimed not as a completed conquest, but as an imminent historical awakening. Closely associated with extreme internationalism and absolute hostility to compromise, Trotskyism holds that world revolution has been delayed, not defeated, and that history is only now beginning to move again, gathering its strength in the ice before advancing beyond it."

governmentlessness_subtype:0 "Governmentlessness"
governmentlessness_subtype_desc:0 "Antarctic Governmentlessness is not a doctrine consciously founded, but a condition elevated into principle, arising from the utter hostility of the southern continent to permanent authority. Rooted in the experiences of the Heroic Age and reinforced by the failures of later mechanized ambition, it holds that Antarctica exists beyond the legitimate reach of the state, where sovereignty collapses under ice and wind alike. In this view, all political systems, parliamentary, totalist, or monarchic, are revealed as artifices sustained only by habit and population density, neither of which can endure at the Pole. The true emblem of order in Antarctica is instead found in the penguin colonies, creatures without law, crown, or ideology, yet governed by instinctive cooperation, shared labor, and collective survival. As human expeditions and prospective colonies press further south, their research stations and planned settlements increasingly resemble these colonies, temporary, fragile, and dependent on communal discipline rather than abstract authority. Power remains informal and meritocratic, resting on competence, endurance, and mutual reliance, echoing the natural hierarchies observed among the birds themselves. Proponents argue that Antarctica represents mankind in a pre political state, where survival tempers ideology and progress is measured not by expansion but by endurance. Often romanticized as the last truly free land on Earth, Antarctic Governmentlessness does not deny humanity’s advance, but contends that any future presence on the ice will remain provisional, constrained by nature itself, and forever overshadowed by the quiet, enduring dominion of the penguins."
