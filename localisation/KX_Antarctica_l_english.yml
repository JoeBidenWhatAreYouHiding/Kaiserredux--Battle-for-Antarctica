### Ideas ###
ANT_alone_idea:0 "’Alone’ at the Bottom of the World"
ANT_alone_idea_desc:0 "Out here in the windswept tundras and blistering icefields of Antarctica, little can survive. However, despite first appearances and common conceptions, it would seem that we are not alone in this frozen hell. From the uncharacteristically organized penguin colonies that seem to waddle with purpose at the behest of some unknown force or figure to the reported sightings of large beasts or wandering spectres seemingly from other worlds, this continent is the last true untainted and unmolested wilderness on Earth, and out here, Man is far from being the master."

ANT_shitty_guns:0 "Unreliable Weaponry"

### Focuses ###
ANT_Frozen_Wasteland:0 "Surviving in a Frozen Wasteland"
ANT_Frozen_Wasteland_desc:0 "Antarctica has been relatively untouched by humans for millennia, and Antarctica seems to be intent on staying that way; against our wishes. Survival here is a constant struggle: we are beset by blistering cold, constant snow and ice, and a complete lack of any tools to build a society. But while Antarctica is tough; mankind is tougher. We will survive and thrive here, no matter how much the frozen deserts of this continent try to repel us"
ANT_Expand_Settlment:0 "Expand Settlement"
ANT_Expand_Settlment_desc:0 "There are hardly enough permanent residents in Antarctica to start a small town; let alone a continent-spanning civilization. To fix this issue; we need to hunker down, expand or die, and encourage everyone; and indeed anyone to claim a piece of this frozen wasteland for themselves. We will give out prizes, cash, free land and guns to anyone brave enough to settle in Antarctica's vast untamed frozen plains and mountains"
ANT_Encourage_Exploration:0 "Encourage Exploration"
ANT_Encourage_Exploration_desc:0 "Antarctica is one of the most mysterious and illusive continents in this big blue world, even now we can barely comprehend how much of this continent has never been seen by human eyes. If we are to survive here, we must go out and explore every single seldom seen inch of this continent, and even encourage fame-hungry go getters to do it for us."
ANT_Research_Stations:0 "Research Stations"
ANT_Research_Stations_desc:0 "Even now, with the Battle for Antarctica in full swing, the majority of the people on this continent are scientists housed in research stations. The vast mystery of this continent of course draws scientists trying to find answers to life's unanswered questions, and who are we to turn them away? We will encourage those with a curios mind to settle here, and observe this pristine land of snow and ice with their own eyes"
ANT_Whale_Oil:0 "Whale Oil"
ANT_Whale_Oil_desc:0 "One of the main drives for exploring Antarctica was to find a reliable source of Whale Oil; and a reliable source we have indeed found. Even though it has fallen out of favor with the rest of the world, we in Antarctica have found a good use for it. With shipments of Oil being scarce, Whale Oil will be used as a steady alternative, helping to keep our shacks illuminated during the long and dark winter months"
ANT_Mineral_Exploration:0 "Look for Minerals"
ANT_Mineral_Exploration_desc:0 "While Antarctic Neutrality prevented the exploration and mining of any minerals, the neutrality that has prevented inhabitation and exploitation of Antarctica is all but dead now. The significant reserves of Oil, Iron Ore and Natural Gas will all be mined to our heart's content, and sold on the international market to make us a pretty penny "
ANT_Permanant_Settlment:0 "Permanent Settlements"
ANT_Permanant_Settlment_desc:0 "Even as we try to colonize Antarctica, year round settlement of this continent is very rare. The majority of inhabitants are simply explorers and researchers who stay for the summers and leave for the brutal winters. However, now we are toughing it out, building our lives into the seemingly endless ice and snow of this continent. While the harsh blizzards and tundra try and beat us back, we will persevere. And when we are done, Antarctica will be ours, permanently "
ANT_Heating_Technology:0 "Advanced Heating"
ANT_Heating_Technology_desc:0 "The vast new wonders in technology that have come about recently have greatly aided in the settlement and colonization of Antarctica. New heaters, thicker and more heat-resistant jackets and technology capable of resisting the seemingly endless cold are immeasurably important to the success of Antarctica's colonization"
ANT_New_Economy:0 "An Ice-Cold ''Economy''"
ANT_New_Economy_desc:0 "While the cold still nags at our every move, and while this continent still lies as vast and untamed as ever, we have built a society in this frozen wasteland. While it is far from the civilization of our dreams, Antarctica is one step closer to being claimed for mankind. Shops are opening, entrepreneurs are making their dreams come true, and families are making a go at it in the middle of nowhere. While life in Antarctica is still dangerous, and far from pleasant, the road to civilization is in sight"

ANT_Formalize_Claims:0 "Formalize Our Claims"
ANT_Formalize_Claims_desc:0 "Until now, claims on Antarctica have been nothing but claims, but with the end of Antarctic neutrality, these claims have become much more formal as nations scramble for legitimacy on this icy continent. With an ever-increasing amount of soldiers and colonists on this continent, we will make these claims official, and bound by more than just pieces of paper"
ANT_Our_Continent:0 "Our Continent"
ANT_Our_Continent_desc:0 "There is no denying the matter: Antarctica is ours for the taking. While no nation has formally had ambitions to conquer Antarctica so far, that changes today. With our wits, our strengths, and our guns, we will march on to the ice shelves of our enemies and claim this pristine tundra for ourselves, and ourselves alone"
ANT_Peaceful_Coexistance:0 "Peaceful Coexistence"
ANT_Peaceful_Coexistance_desc:0 "Antarctica is the only continent thus far to never see an armed conflict. It shall remain that way, as we have no intention of riddling the pristine ice shelves of this continent with bullet holes. Just as always, we will continue exploring and colonizing within our own territories, leaving the other claimants on this continent well enough alone"

ANT_Battle_for_Antarctica:0 "The Battle for Antactica"
ANT_Battle_for_Antarctica_desc:0 "We sit at the bottom of the world, at the head of a vast, unexplored frozen tundra. Untouched by man for millennia, Antarctica is truly the last frontier in this world, and with the neutrality of this white continent coming to an end; mankind is set to conquer the last piece of pristine land on this blue marble. "
ANT_Request_Support:0 "Request More Supplies"
ANT_Request_Support_desc:0 "We have not come to this frozen tundra alone. The settlement of Antarctica has always come about as a result of the whims of outside powers, our current situation is no different. Unfortunately, with our terrain covered in ice and snow providing for ourselves on a large scale is neigh impossible, and we are forced to grovel to our overlords for supplies. Food, Water, Oil, Winter Gear and Guns are all necessities, to protect against the elements, and any wandering foes that inhabit this frozen wasteland "
ANT_Melee_Weapons:0 "Melee Weapons"
ANT_Melee_Weapons_desc:0 "We barely have enough guns to supply our 'army'. In lieu of firearms, melee weapons such as knives, axes, hatchets and icepicks will help defend our territory, and will assist with the transformation of this frozen wasteland. "
ANT_Scavenge_Weaponry:0 "Scavenge Weaponry"
ANT_Scavenge_Weaponry_desc:0 "Despite our puny population, we barely have enough guns to equip our populace. To defend our land, we will use anything at our disposal, no longer what weaponry we use. Everything from old guns scattered on the vast terrain, to rifles pried out of the hands of dead soldiers, to cheap guns bought on the international market with the little spare change we have. Anything helps"
ANT_Protect_Against_the_Elements:0 "Protecting Against the Elements"
ANT_Protect_Against_the_Elements_desc:0 "Life in Antarctica is a constant battle for survival. Whether it be the blistering cold, the predatory wildlife, or other men eager to claim this continent for their selves; everywhere lies crouching foes. This state of constant red alert will mean that ever man, every settler and scientist will be armed to the teeth with every weapon we have at out disposal."
